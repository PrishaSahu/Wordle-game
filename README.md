# Wordle Game

This is a simple Wordle game implementation in Python. 
Similar to the popular NYT game, the user is required to input a valid 5 letter word. Upon pressing enter, each of the 5 letters are in either green, yellow, or white. Green indicates that the letter is in the word
and is in the right place. ellow indicates that the letter is in the word but not in the right place. Grey indicates that the letter isn't in the word.
If the user is able to get the word in 6 or less than 6 guesses, the game congratulates you and displays the number of guesses the user took to get there.
